# Blockspace
Blockspace is a small game coded in java using chatGPT codex.

Do download, download the latest release, extract it, and run launch.vbs. If you make any changes to the code, run `gradlew build` in a command prompt in the folder first to compile it. You need to install java 21 and gradlew for it to run.


If you run into any bugs, errors, or issues, please let me know.
Also, if you have any ideas for stuff i should add (other than black holes or water), again, let me know.
